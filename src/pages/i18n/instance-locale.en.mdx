# Changing locales locally

A global locale configuration can be problematic when passing around date-times that may need to be formatted into different locale.

Exactly the same as `dayjs#locale`, but only use locale in a specific instance and returns a new instance by switching to new locale.

```js
require("dayjs/locale/de");
dayjs().locale("de").format(); // use loaded locale locally
```
