# Changing locale globally

By default, Day.js comes with English locale **only**.

If you need other locales, you can load them on demand.

```js
require("dayjs/locale/de");
```

Once you load a locale, it becomes the active locale. To change active locales, simply call `dayjs.locale` with the key of a loaded locale to change global locale.

Changing the global locale doesn't affect existing instances.

```js
dayjs.locale("de"); // use loaded locale globally
dayjs.locale("en"); // switch back to default English locale globally
```
