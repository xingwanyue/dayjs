# Now

Calling `dayjs()` without parameters returns a fresh Day.js object with the current date and time.

```js
var now = dayjs();
```

This is essentially the same as calling `dayjs(new Date())`.

Day.js treats `dayjs(undefined)` as `dayjs()` due to that function parameters default to undefined when not passed in.

Day.js treats `dayjs(null)` as an invalid input.
