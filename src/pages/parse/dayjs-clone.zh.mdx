# Dayjs Clone

All Day.js objects are immutable. Still, dayjs#clone can create a clone of the current object if you need one.

```js
var a = dayjs();
var b = a.clone();
// a and b are two separate Day.js object
```

Calling dayjs() on a Day.js object will clone it as well.

```js
var a = dayjs();
var b = dayjs(a);
```
