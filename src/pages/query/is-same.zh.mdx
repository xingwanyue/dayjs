# Is Same

This indicates whether the Day.js object is the same as the other supplied date-time.

```js
dayjs().isSame(dayjs("2011-01-01")); // default milliseconds
```

If you want to limit the granularity to a unit other than milliseconds, pass it as the second parameter.

When including a second parameter, it will match all units equal or larger. Passing in `month` will check `month` and `year`. Passing in `day` will check `day`, `month`, and `year`.

```js
dayjs().isSame("2011-01-01", "year");
```

Units are case insensitive, and support plural and short forms.
