# Day of Week (Locale Aware)

Gets or sets the day of the week according to the locale.

<Callout>This requires the [Weekday](../plugin/weekday) plugin to work</Callout>

If the locale assigns Sunday as the first day of the week, `dayjs().weekday(0)` will be Sunday. If Monday is the first day of the week, `dayjs().weekday(0)` will be Monday.

```js
dayjs.extend(weekday);

// when Sunday is the first day of the week
dayjs().weekday(-7); // last Sunday
dayjs().weekday(7); // next Sunday

// when Monday is the first day of the week
dayjs().weekday(-7); // last Monday
dayjs().weekday(7); // next Monday

// when Sunday is the first day of the week
dayjs().weekday(-5); // last Tuesday (5th day before Sunday)
dayjs().weekday(5); // next Friday (5th day after Sunday)
```
