# ISO Day of Week

Gets or sets the [ISO day of the week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date) with 1 being Monday and 7 being Sunday.

<Callout>
  This requires the [IsoWeek](../plugin/iso-week) plugin to work
</Callout>

```javascript
dayjs.extend(isoWeek);

dayjs().isoWeekday(); // gets the current ISO day of the week
dayjs().isoWeekday(1); // Monday
```
