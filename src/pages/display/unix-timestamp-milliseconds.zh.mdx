# Unix Timestamp (milliseconds)

This returns the number of milliseconds since the Unix Epoch of the Day.js object.

```js
dayjs("2019-01-25").valueOf() + // 1548381600000
  dayjs(1548381600000); // 1548381600000
```

To get a Unix timestamp (the number of **seconds** since the epoch) from a Day.js object, you should use [Unix Timestamp](./unix-timestamp).
